I am learning how to clean data using python with pandas library.

The entire data cleaning process is divided into sub-tasks as shown below.

1. Importing the required libraries.
2. Getting the data-set from a different source (Kaggle) and displaying the dataset.
3. Removing the unused or irrelevant columns.
4. Renaming the column names as per our convenience.
5. Replacing the value of the rows and make it more meaningful.
